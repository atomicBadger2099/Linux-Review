LINUX DEVICE MANAGEMENT:


general commands to learn:
	ls -la - displays folders by list and permission type
	ls -la /dev - shows list of devices in filesystem
	fdisk -l - shows all partitions on a Linux system
	lsblk - shows information on block devices
	mount - used to mount a device
	umount - used to unmount a device
	df - used to get basic information on hard disk or mounted devices
	fsck - used to check a device system for errors. Devices must be unmounted.

definitions:
	mounting- attaching a file or device to the Linux filesystem
	unmounting - removing a file or device from the linux filesystem
	/dev - directory of devices in a Linux filesystem. (ls -la /dev is useful.)
	

device types:
	1) character- data is transferred by a peripheral - mouse or keyboard - i.e. user input.
	2) block - data is transferred in block data form - i.e., within system.
	
	virtual vs physical differentiation also exists. 
		for example, snap packages are mounted at a virtual mounting point called a loop. loopo, loop1, ...loop_x.
		
names of drives:
	sda - first drive: sda1, sda2, sda3, ...sda_x, partitions of sda
	sdb - second drive: sdb1, sdb3, sdb3, ...sdb_x, partitions of sdb
	sdc - third drive; similarly named partitions.
	sd_x - progressively named drives. similarly named partitions.
	
mounting a drive to a system normally - example:
	mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
	
mounting a drive to a specific directory - example:
	mount /dev/sdc1 /media 
	(mounts a device to the media directory).
	
unmounting a device - example:
 	umount /dev/sdb1
